      <h2 id="family">Family</h2>
<p><img class="rightsideimage" src="../images/dan_and_jane.jpg" alt="Dan and Jane" title="Dan and Jane"></p>
<p>I was raised in Chatham, NJ, where my mother still works as a psychoanalyst. My father lives in the Philadelphia area and runs <a href="http://www.cortconsulting.com/">Cort Consulting Group</a>. My step-father is the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Seeking-Degrees-Freedom-Ward-Dill/dp/1503329631/">Seeking Degrees of Freedom</a> and the woodworker of <a href="http://engrainedwood.com/">Engrained Wood Art</a>. My sister Elizabeth and her husband Mike live in Washington DC. I also have a half-brother and a bunch of step-siblings scattered around.</p>
<p>I married my wife Jane on the tenth anniversary of us being together. Jane is a graduate student in Biological Anthropology at Yale University working with <a href="http://anthropology.yale.edu/people/david-watts">David Watts</a>.</p>
<h2 id="accomplishments">Accomplishments</h2>
<p><img class="rightsideimage" src="../images/tying_the_plane_down.JPG" alt="Tying the plane down" title="Tying the plane down"> I am a black belt (nidan) of Isshin Kempo karate. I studied first with Shifu Chris Goedecke at the <a href="http://isshinkempo.com/">Wind School</a> when I was in grade school. After taking a break at college, I spent one year at <a href="http://web.mit.edu/~isshinryu/www/">MIT’s Isshinryu club</a> and two years with Sensei Randy Stone at the Inner Peace karate dojo before returning to Shifu Chris at the Wind School.</p>
<p>I earned my private pilot license in 2005. I’m a little rusty now, but I’m looking forward to getting back into it if I ever get the money and time.</p>
<h2 id="hobbies">Hobbies</h2>
<p><img class="rightsideimage" src="../images/dansparringfred.jpg" alt="Sparring" title="Sparring"> I like playing bridge, and I typically play weekly with some friends. I’m also a fan of escape rooms and modern “euro”-style board games. My favorites shift over time, but right now, I’m enjoying “Crusaders Thy Will Be Done”, “Terraforming Mars”, “Gloomhaven”, and “Hanabi”.</p>
<!-- I enjoy amateur photography.  I'm especially fond of my home-made infrared filter for my camera which allows me to take some pretty cool still pictures. -->
<!-- Here are some of my favorites. -->
<p>I love to ski (and occasionally snowboard). Whenever I get a chance, I try to find a good mountain and hit the glades.</p>
<p>I started playing the trombone when I was in grade school, and I still try to pull it out as often as I can. At Brown University, I played in the <a href="http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Music/ensembles/jazzband.html">Jazz Ensemble</a> (2005-2008), and when I lived in Boston, I was a member of the <a href="http://www.crwe.org/">Charles River Wind Ensemble</a> (2008-2009). I was also involved in the Computer Science Department Ska Band Skacappella at Yale for its brief existence (2010).</p>
