## Family

I was raised in Chatham, NJ, where my mother still works as a psychoanalyst.  My
father lives in the Philadelphia area and runs [Cort Consulting
Group](http://www.cortconsulting.com/).  My step-father is the author of
[Seeking Degrees of Freedom](http://www.amazon.com/Seeking-Degrees-Freedom-Ward-Dill/dp/1503329631/)
and is a prolific woodworker.  My sister Elizabeth and her husband Mike live in
Washington DC.  I also have a half-brother and a bunch of step-siblings
scattered around.


I married my wife Jane on the tenth anniversary of us being together.  Jane is a graduate student in Biological Anthropology at Yale University working with [David Watts](http://anthropology.yale.edu/people/david-watts).


## Accomplishments

I am a black belt (nidan) of Isshin Kempo karate.  I studied first with Shifu
Chris Goedecke at the [Wind School](http://isshinkempo.com/) when I was in grade
school.  After taking a break at college, I spent one year at [MIT's Isshinryu
club](http://web.mit.edu/~isshinryu/www/) and two years with Sensei Randy Stone
at the Inner Peace karate dojo before returning to Shifu Chris at the Wind
School.

I earned my private pilot license in 2005.  I'm a little rusty now, but I'm
looking forward to getting back into it if I ever get the money and time.

## Hobbies

I like playing bridge, and I typically play weekly with some friends.
I'm also a fan of escape rooms and modern "euro"-style board games.  My favorites shift over time, but right now, I'm enjoying "Crusaders Thy Will Be Done", "Terraforming Mars", "Gloomhaven", and "Hanabi".

<!-- I enjoy amateur photography.  I'm especially fond of my home-made infrared filter for my camera which allows me to take some pretty cool still pictures. -->
<!-- Here are some of my favorites. -->


I love to ski (and occasionally snowboard).  Whenever I get a chance, I try to find a good mountain and hit the glades.

I started playing the trombone when I was in grade school, and I still try to pull it out as often as I can.  At Brown University, I played in the [Jazz Ensemble](http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Music/ensembles/jazzband.html) (2005-2008), and when I lived in Boston, I was a member of the [Charles River Wind Ensemble](http://www.crwe.org/) (2008-2009).  I was also involved in the Computer Science Department Ska Band "Skacappella" at Yale for its brief existence (2010).
