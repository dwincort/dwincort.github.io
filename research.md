# Research interests

I'm interested in programming language theory, particularly in functional languages and type systems.  I enjoy thinking about purely theoretical problems, but my work is usually built upon a concrete domain.  For instance, I explored the ideas of functional reactive programming in the contexts of music and user interfaces for my PhD.

## Recent Work

From 2015-2017, I worked on a language for _adaptive differential privacy_ with [Benjamin Pierce](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/) at the University of Pennsylvania.  Our language, [Adaptive Fuzz](https://github.com/dwincort/AdaptiveFuzz), incorporates state of the art adaptive privacy filters into a system framework to allow standard differential privacy mechanisms to be usable in a safe and intuitive way.

My graduate work, under the late [Paul Hudak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Hudak), was on functional reactive programming.  I designed a system of resource types for safety and clarity, and worked on a system of asynchronous concurrency.  Specifically, I spent much time on the computer music language [Euterpea and](http://haskell.cs.yale.edu/?page_id=103) its arrowized graphical package [UISF](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/UISF).

Over the summer of 2011, I interned at Microsoft Research in Cambridge, UK with [Simon Marlow](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/simonmar/). I initially worked on adding data and type declarations to GHCi (see the [git commit](https://github.com/ghc/ghc/commit/3db757241ce7fb99c096c30481aefa86bb9855a1)), and then I worked on new features for the [Par monad](https://github.com/simonmar/monad-par).

You can find my resume [here](\data\danwc-resume.pdf).

## Conferences

I have volunteered and been active at a number of conferences and workshops:

- I was on the program committee for [PADL](https://popl18.sigplan.org/track/PADL-2018) (the symposium on the Practical Aspects of Declarative Programming) 16, 17, and 18.
- I was on the artifact evaluation committee for [POPL](https://popl18.sigplan.org/) 2018.
- I was on the program committee for [FARM](https://functional-art.org/) in 2018 and the Program Chair in 2019.
