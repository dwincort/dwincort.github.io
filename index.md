Daniel Winograd-Cort is a Senior Software Engineer at [Luminous Computing](https://luminous.co/) where he uses Haskell and methods from programming language theory to help design photonic computer chips.  He earned his undergraduate degree from Brown University in 2008 and his PhD from Yale University in 2015.

Daniel's main interests lie in programming languages, although he often thinks about other random problems when they're particularly interesting.
